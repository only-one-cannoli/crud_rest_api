# CRUD REST API

## Summary

This repo contains a basic create-read-update-delete (CRUD) API with standard endpoints (POST, GET, PATCH, and DELETE).  The Python code leverages the Tornado web framework and interfaces with a SQLite database.  It passes many tests with static-analysis tools (`black`, `isort`, `pylint`, `mypy`, `bandit`, `pytest`, and `pipenv check`).  Run the app with `pipenv run python -m src.main` from the top-level directory within the repo.  You can then issue commands like `requests.post('http://localhost:888/api/widgets', params={'name': 'widget1', 'parts': '5'})` and get reasonable responses.

## Getting started

You'll need `git`, Python 3.9, and `pipenv`.  After cloning down the repo, navigate into the repo's top-level directory and use `pipenv install` to get all of the packages set up within a virtual environment.  Remember to use `pipenv run` or `pipenv shell` to work within the virtual environment; otherwise, you'll be using whatever Python packages you have installed otherwise.

## Checking the code

Here is a `pipenv shell` session illustrating the results of various static-analysis tools applied to the codebase.
